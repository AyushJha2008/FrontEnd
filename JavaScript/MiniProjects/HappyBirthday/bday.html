            <h2>Dear Bhaiji,</h2>
            <p id="para">On your special day, I just want to remind you, Your kindness, strength, and wisdom inspire me every single day. Itâ€™s been 1.5 year since you've been away from house(not from our minds and hearts), and we miss you so much. we wish we could be there with you today to celebrate, laugh, and make memories together.

                Even though weâ€™re apart for now, my love, respect and best wishes are always with you. i hope this wall of distance will break soon and i will truly try to match my skills with your your expectations <br> sorry for every trouble i caused you till now!
                
                Happy Birthday once again! ðŸ¥³ðŸŽˆ
                <br><br>
                May this birthday bring you all the happiness, success, and love that you truly deserve</p>
